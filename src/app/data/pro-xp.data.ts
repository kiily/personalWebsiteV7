        description: `My current role is focused on the development of web and hybrid mobile apps using standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS) and the latest version of modern web and mobile development frameworks (Angular 6/7, Ionic 4, Cordova 8). I am also working on building a design system using web components built with Stencil.js; these components are used across all our apps. I am also responsible for the maintenance of custom Angular schematics that allow us to rapidly create components out of the box using the Angular CLI.
        On a more admin side, I help manage a team of 6 developers and am heavily involved in writing documentation about the platform. This documentation was initially hosted on Github and has now been ported to Confluence. Jira is our current project management tool, but we were previously using Monday and Trello.`

        cancer. The project results were presented in a final poster in a research symposium; a small 
        report was also produced.`
