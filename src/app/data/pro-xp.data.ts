        targeting the upstream levels of the Wnt-Frizzled cascade, specifically at the level of 
        β-catenin stabilization to identify potential anti-cancer compounds acting on the Frizzled 
        homologue 7 (Fzd7) receptor which promotes cancer cell proliferation in triple negative breast 
        cancer. The project results were presented in a final poster in a research symposium; a small 
        report was also produced.`
